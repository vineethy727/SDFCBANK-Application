            <p>Internet shopping has revolutionized the retail trade over the past 25 years or so, both for consumers and vendors. The internet currently accounts for over 10% of retail sales in the USA, and this number continues to rise.<p></p>
				Many products can be found for a more affordable price online, and having the product delivered to your door can be very convenient.
				However, critics note the packaging waste, time, and cost delay caused by delivery and the possible problems that occur when buyers can't inspect the product in person or communicate face-to-face with a retailer before buying.</p>
        	<p>Internet banking is performed through a computer system or similar devices that can connect to the banking site. Nowadays, you can also use internet banking on your mobile phones, using a Wi-Fi or 3G connection. With the easy availability of cyber cafes and mobile phones in India and China, online banking has become quite popular.

You no longer need to visit the bank in person to deposit or withdraw money, request an account statement, or stop a payment. You can do all of these tasks, and many more, using the online services offered by the banks.<p></P> You can also keep track of your account transactions and balance at all times. You no longer need to get passbooks updated to know your total account balance.
